description: "Today, I am going to bore you with the technologies I am acquainted with.“A jack of all trades is a master of none.” the saying pretty much applies to me. Being a philomath, I have tried my hands on numerous technologoies. "

In my defense, I will say the complete saying was originally

	<blockquote>
		<p>A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.</p>

I believe in today's world, it is necessary that you be knowledgable of all the new technolgies that are developed and released.

I had done my final year project in ASP.Net using MVC framework.
During my internship, I worked on Java technologies - **Strut, Hibernate, Spring**.

When I was working, I used VBScript a lot majorly for automating MS Excel tasks.

My latest projects are based in **MEAN** and **React**.
